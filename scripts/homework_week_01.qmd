### Question 1
Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 3 water and 11 land. Construct the posterior distribution
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# create p_grid
p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 100)

# create prior distributoin
prior <- rep(1, 20)

# compute likelihood at each value in the grid
# data for globe tossing with 3 water and 11 land
likelihood <- dbinom(3, size = 14, prob = p_grid)

# calculate posterior 
unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = p_grid, y = posterior)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
```
